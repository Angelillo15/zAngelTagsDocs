# Installing the plugin into the server

Now that you have downloaded the plugin to your computer, you need to install it in your server(s). This is a folder containing a Purpur 1.19 server, but it is very similar to a Spigot or Paper server:

![Main directory of a Purpur 1.19 server](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png>)

Now, navigate into the /plugins directory, and drop in the zAngelTags-x.x.jar into the folder. If you don't have PlaceholderAPI installed yet, this is the moment. Repeat the same download process with PlaceholderAPI from SpigotMC clicking here. Then, drop the PlaceholderAPI-x.x.x.jar into the same directory as the zAngelTags. Now, you can start the server to generate the plugin configurations.&#x20;
